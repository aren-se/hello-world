# hello-world
This is a test ... I'm aspiring to data/machine learning/ai for personal interest and the greater good.

Currently taking Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree ... on Github to learn to post my questions.

In the mean time, if you care to address them on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIOexhH_8cr_WsXtIjQ-Snmj0p1L9VUqmmgAu5UVuSI/edit I'd love to get some help!  None of it's hard, except when there's something you don't know ...

- Thank you
